# Revolutionizing Age, Gender, and Ethnicity Recognition with Multi-Modal Vision Transformers

This repository contains the source code for age, gender, and ethnicity detection using Vision Transformers (ViT). The project explores three different attention mechanisms integrated with ViT: CBAM, Coordinate Attention, and Self-Attention.

## Repository Structure

- `age-gender-ethnicity-detection-using-vit_CBAM.ipynb`: Jupyter notebook implementing Vision Transformer with CBAM (Convolutional Block Attention Module) for age, gender, and ethnicity detection.
- `age-gender-ethnicity-detection-using-vit_coordinate_attention.ipynb`: Jupyter notebook implementing Vision Transformer with Coordinate Attention for age, gender, and ethnicity detection.
- `age-gender-ethnicity-detection-using-vit_self_attention.ipynb`: Jupyter notebook implementing Vision Transformer with Self-Attention for age, gender, and ethnicity detection.

## Dataset

The model training and evaluation are conducted on the publicly available **UTK-Face** dataset. This dataset contains images labeled with age, gender, and ethnicity information.

- Dataset: [UTK-Face Dataset](https://susanqq.github.io/UTKFace/)

## Usage

1. Clone the repository:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/Sanjay71013/Multi-Modal_Vision-Transformer_For_Age-Gender-Ethnicity.git
cd age-gender-ethnicity-detection-vits
```

2. Install the required libraries
   
```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

## Usage

Open the desired notebook in Jupyter Notebook or JupyterLab:

```bash
jupyter notebook age-gender-ethnicity-detection-using-vit_CBAM.ipynb
```

## Results

Detailed results and evaluations of the models can be found in the Results section of each notebook. The notebooks provide visualizations of the training process and model performance metrics.
